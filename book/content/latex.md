# $\LaTeX$ colors

To obtain pretty colors in $\LaTeX$ we define several color classes, being

- red
- blue
- green
- raspberry
- yellow
- darkGreen
- orange
- cyan
- gray
- purple
- pink
- darkBlue

so that in $\LaTeX$ we can use the code

```
\class{<color>}{<math>}
```

to obtain $\LaTeX$ that is rendered in the color `<color>`.

## Example

```text
:::::{math}

\class{raspberry}{\LaTeX}

:::::
````

renders as

:::::{math}

\class{raspberry}{\LaTeX}

:::::

Note that without applying the TU Delft theme the default text color is chosen.
