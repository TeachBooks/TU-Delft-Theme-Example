# Exercises
The syntax to use exercises is the following:
```
::::::{exercise} <title>
<content>
::::::
```
where `<content>` is what will be inside the exercise. `<title>` will be displayed in the top part of the admonition. In this chapter we present classes of admonitions available, and their styling in the TU Delft theme.


## Example
::::::{exercise} Solve for x
Solve the equation $x^2 - 4 = 0$.
::::::
```
