# Admonitions
The syntax to use admonitions is the following:
```
::::::{admonition} <title>
:class: <class>
<content>
::::::
```
where `<class>` is the type of admonition used, and `<content>` is what will be inside the admonition. `<title>` will be displayed in the top part of the admonition. In this chapter we present classes of admonitions available, and their styling in the TU Delft theme.

## `:class: solution`
::::::{admonition} Solution to the exercise 1.1
:class: solution
$2 + 2 = 4$
::::::
```
::::::{admonition} Solution to the exercise 1.1
:class: solution
$2 + 2 = 4$
::::::
```

**Hint**: You can also add class `dropdown` to make the content of the admonition hidden by default, and make it expandable. For example:
::::::{admonition} Solution to the exercise 1.1
:class: solution, dropdown
$2 + 2 = 4$
::::::
```
::::::{admonition} Solution to the exercise 1.1
:class: solution, dropdown
