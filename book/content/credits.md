## How the book is made

This book is created using open source tools: it is a JupyterBook that is written using Markdown and Jupyter notebooks. Additional tooling is used from the [TeachBooks initiative](https://teachbooks.io/) to enhance the editing and reading experience. The files are stored on a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/TeachBooks/TU-Delft-Theme-Example). The website can be viewed at [this link](https://teachbooks.io/TU-Delft-Theme-Example/main/content/intro.html). View the repository README file or contact the authors for additional information.
