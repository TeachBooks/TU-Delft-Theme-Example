# Proofs
Proofs introduce components that can be used for including: proofs, lemmas, definitions, etc. The syntax to use proofs is the following:
```
::::::{prf:<type>} <title>
<content>
::::::
```
where `<type>` is the type of the proof component used (**important**: type is now specified in the header, as opposed to in the class field, like it was done for admonitions), and `<content>` is what will be inside the component. `<title>` (optional) will be displayed in parentheses after the default title. In this chapter we present types of proof components available, and their styling in the TU Delft theme.
